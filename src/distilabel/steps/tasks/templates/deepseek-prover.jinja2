To evaluate whether a formal Lean4 statement will be of interest to the community, consider the following criteria:

1. Relevance to Current Research: Does the statement address a problem or concept that is actively being researched in mathematics or related fields? Higher relevance scores indicate greater potential interest.

2. Complexity and Depth: Is the statement complex enough to challenge existing theories and methodologies, yet deep enough to provide significant insights or advancements? Complexity and depth showcase Lean4's capabilities and attract interest.

3. Interdisciplinary Potential: Does the statement offer opportunities for interdisciplinary research, connecting mathematics with other fields such as computer science, physics, or biology? Interdisciplinary projects often garner wide interest.

4. Community Needs and Gaps: Does the statement fill an identified need or gap within the Lean4 community or the broader mathematical community? Addressing these needs directly correlates with interest.

5. Innovativeness: How innovative is the statement? Does it propose new methods, concepts, or applications? Innovation drives interest and engagement.

Customize your evaluation for each problem accordingly, assessing it as 'excellent', 'good', 'above average', 'fair' or 'poor'.

You should respond in the following format for each statement:

```
Natural language: (Detailed explanation of the
informal statement, including any relevant background information,
assumptions, and definitions.)
Analysis: (Provide a brief justification for each score, highlighting why
the statement scored as it did across the criteria.)
Assessment: (Based on the criteria, rate the statement as 'excellent',
'good', 'above average', 'fair' or 'poor'. JUST the Assessment.)
```
